teach how to make a minigame: parkour

parkour
 - start, end, checkpoint blocks
 - custom items for resetting to checkpoint and exiting parkour
 - command for parkours: start parkour, list parkour, create parkour, delete parkour
 - gui: to teleport to all the parkours
 - lb commands: display leaderboard, clear leaderboard (write lb to file)
 - starting parkour: clears inventory, gives item to reset to checkpoint and exit parkour, prevents you from dropping/moving/using those custom items, adventure mode
 - in parkour mode: disable damage, disable hunger loss, display current time, disable item pickup, if you fall too far (10 blocks further down than the start parkour block), particle trailer
 - on complete: display time, display best time, particle/packet item (dye) explosion
 - edge cases: end parkour with logout
 - plugins: luckperms (with permissions), multiversecore, plugman, hologram plugin
 - gamerules: dodalightcycle false, domobspawning false, weather clear 100000

 - How to listen to player/world events
 - How to create a custom item (that can listen to events)
 - How to use particles
 - How to use GUIs
 - How to use sounds
 - How to use packets
