teach how to make a minigame: parkour

coding plan
 00) refactor package, build, load, (also show gradle, gitignore), YML, MAIN CLASS
 01) Create Parkour: ParkourManager, ParkourPlayerManager, (before do Parkour) ParkourCommand, register, YML, MAIN CLASS
 02) Load Data: Parkour, MAIN CLASS
 03) Events: PlayerManager (read comments for showing how to search)
 04) TODO: Independent events--PlayerManager (quit, hunger, hurt, gamemode change) make them search on their own
 05) Checkpoints: ParkourPlayerManager, PlayerManager
 --- TODO: halfway checkpoint
 10) Leaderboard: SortType, Parkour#(getSortedLeaderboard, printLeaderboard, clearLeaderboard), LeaderboardCommand, YML, MAIN CLASS
 11) Reset: AdminCommand, YML, MAIN CLASS
 12) Stats: PlayerManager jumps, deaths (next step for time)
 13) Runnable: PlayerManager (ticks, trail, action bar)
 14) Items: !!PlayerManager!!, CustomItemType, ItemManager, ParkourPlayerManager, MAIN CLASS
 15) TODO: Independent Items--ItemManager, ParkourPlayerManager (reset to checkpoint)
 16) Challenge: what issues does this plugin have (which parkour are you starting, doesn't require checkpoints, annoying spam), and how would you maybe go about fixing them?

dropped
 - How to use GUIs
 - How to use packets
 - gui: to teleport to all the parkours
 - on complete: particle/packet item (dye) explosion, display best time

done
 - start, end, checkpoint blocks
 - custom items for resetting to checkpoint and exiting parkour
 - lb commands: display leaderboard, clear leaderboard (write lb to file)
 - starting parkour: clears inventory, gives item to reset to checkpoint and exit parkour, prevents you from dropping/moving/using those custom items, adventure mode
 - edge cases: end parkour with logout
 - plugins: luckperms (with permissions), multiversecore, plugman
 - gamerules: dodalightcycle false, domobspawning false, weather clear 100000
 - in parkour mode: disable damage, disable hunger loss, display current time, disable item pickup, if you fall too far (10 blocks further down than the start parkour block), particle trail
 - command for parkours: start parkour, list parkour, create parkour, delete parkour
 - on complete: display time
